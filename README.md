# Mortality Patterns & Insights for Public Health - Regression Model

This project focuses on analyzing mortality patterns and extracting insights to inform public health interventions using a regression model.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to explore relationships between various factors and mortality rates. By developing a regression model, the project aims to predict mortality rates and derive insights for public health strategies.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and nature of the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into features suitable for machine learning.
- **Model Selection**: Comparison of multiple regression models to choose the most accurate and suitable model for the dataset.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy.
- **Public Health Insights**: Insights derived from the analysis to inform and improve public health interventions.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model building.
- `models/`: Saved models for future use.
- `reports/`: Final analysis reports and visualizations.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
